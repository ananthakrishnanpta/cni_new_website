<div>{{ "This is an intermediate level course on communication networks with emphasis on hands-on experimentation. A unique feature of this course is the integration of the course instructions with a sand-box lab environment where participants can try out the exercises through the browser interface itself, without installing any special software.
The course currently includes six modules (approx. 4 hours/module):
* Module 1: Introduction to networking and end-to-end walkthrough
* Module 2: Network building blocks and essential tools
* Module 3: Path computation (routing) and introduction to graph algorithms.
* Module 4: Reliability, flow control, and congestion control
* Module 5: Advanced networking (virtualisation, overlays, filters)
* Module 6: Software Defined Networking.

<br>
The course content and the sandbox lab environment can be accessed by registering at [https://netlab.cnihackathon.in](https://netlab.cnihackathon.in)." | markdownify }}<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/CN_course.png"></div>

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
