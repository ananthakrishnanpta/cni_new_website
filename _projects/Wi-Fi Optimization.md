Centrally Controlled Overlay Time-Sliced Scheduling for the QoS Management of WiFi Networks
- PIs: Anurag Kumar and Joy Kuri
- First 6 to 9 months work presented on 17th October 2022, in WiNTECH, the 16th ACMÂ  workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation & CHaracterization, held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom 2022, Sydney
- Since then, the following efforts are under way
    - Replace frame-based scheduling with index-based scheduling
    - Extend ADWISER for general networks by developing it in the context of a 2AP-4STA lab network
    - Some details on the next two slides  

Machine learning techniques for WiFi networks
- PIs: Anurag Kumar and Aditya Gopalan
- We are developing a deep-learning model for wireless propagation within our academic building
- Next, we aim to develop reinforcement learning techniques for the QoS management of WiFi networks
