This yearâ€™s summer school will be in the form of a short course on Dynamic resource allocation problems in communication networks by Dr. Alexandre Reiffers-Masson, Assistant Professor
 ,IMT Atlantique (Brest). 
 It will be conducted in hybrid mode (online as well as in-person participation in IISc Campus).

**Bio of the Speaker**

Alexandre Reiffers is an assistant professor at IMT Atlantique (Brest). He was previously a post-doctoral fellow at Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems. He received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics (2010) from the university of Marseille, the master degree in applied mathematics (2012) from the university of Pierre et Marie CURIE and the Ph.D. degree in computer science (January 2016) from the INRIA (National research institute in computer science and control) and the university of Avignon. Most of his research projects concern the application of mathematical tools (game theory, optimization, stochastic process and machine learning) for a better understanding of real-world problems. The different issues that he studies touch topics such as networks, economy and manufacturing. 


**Course description:** 

Ten sessions (one theory and one lab session each day, for a total of five days) to discuss: 
 - Heuristics to solve dynamic resource allocation problems in the communication networks using MDPs. 
 - LP-based and Whittle index policies. 
 - Deep reinforcement learning algorithms for such problems. 
 - Illustration of the techniques on different problems: adaptive routing, TCP control, optimal control of the age of information, and optimal channel selection. 
 - Python codes to implement such algorithms. 

**Schedule**
- Dates: May 02-06
- Venue: Room MP-20, ECE Department, IISc, Bangalore
